## Setting up Locally using Docker (Recommended Method)

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**: Download and install Docker.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AverageBlank/URLShortener.git
   cd URLShortener
   ```

2. **Setup environment variables**

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and paste the following variables:

  ```env
  link={your_mongo_uri}
  SECRET_KEY={your_secret_key}
  ```

  - Now set the `link` and `SECRET_KEY` variables in the `.env` file according to your needs.

3. **Run the container**

- Start the MongoDB & Flask server with one of the following command:
  ```bash
  docker compose up
  ```
  **_or if you encounter compatibility issues, use the following command:_**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

4. **Open your browser**

   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the application running locally.

## Setting up Locally (without Docker)

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and MongoDB installed on your system.

- **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**: Install Python.
- **[MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)**: Follow MongoDB's installation guide.
- **[MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)** **_(optional)_**: A GUI for MongoDB.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AverageBlank/URLShortener.git
   cd URLShortener
   ```

2. **Run install script**

   - Linux/MacOS: `bash install.sh`
   - Windows: `.\install.bat`

3. **Run MongoDB**

   - Start the MongoDB server. If you installed MongoDB locally, you can start it with the following command:
     ```bash
     mongod
     ```

4. **Connect to MongoDB with MongoDB Compass** **_(optional)_**

   - Open MongoDB Compass.
   - In the "New Connection" window, enter your MongoDB URI in the connection string field (this is the same URI you entered during the install phase (present in the `.env` file in root directory of the project)).
   - Click "Connect" to connect to your MongoDB server.
   - You can now view and manage your databases and collections through the Compass GUI.

5. **Run the application**

   - Linux/MacOS: `bash start.sh`
   - Windows: `.\start.bat`

6. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the application running locally.
